# Sunshine for Wear

Mock weather app with an Android Wear watchface. This was completed as the 6th project in the Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree. Starting with a mock weather app, I created a custom watch face that receives data via the DataLayer API. Watch face works when the wearable is both active and in ambient mode.

## Features

Shows today's date and current time
Displays high and low temperature
Includes graphic for weather condition
Optimized for battery performance and use in ambient mode
Glanceable: Text and background changes appearance based on the weather

## How to Run

Download the project zip file (unzip it if necessary) and open the root folder in Android Studio. First run the "app" module on a connected Android Device. Then run the "sunshineforwear" module on a wearable device or emulator. You will need to pair the phone and wearable in order to sync with the watch face. If using an emulator, follow the instructions [here](https://developer.android.com/training/wearables/apps/creating.html).

## Compatibility

Sunshine app works on Android phones running Android v10 or later. Watch face will work on both square and round Android Wear devices.
